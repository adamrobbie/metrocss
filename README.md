MetroCSS
========

###Incorporates

*	jQuery 1.5.1 (will be updated and refactored)
*	SASS for cleaner CSS code
*	user-definable color themes
*	minimized assets (to be implemented)
*	starter index.html
*	live tiles via Drew Greenwell


I wanted to create a starter template for anyone who wanted to create a Metro style homepage

###Things that need to be done

*	Incorporate Valipour's pivot controls and Greenwels livetils jQuery. Update it, than refactor along the way
*	Combine CSS files
*	Introduce a Grid system

Just run:
``git clone git@github.com:adamrobbie/metrocss.git``

###Instructions are included in the index.html

If you haven't installed Ender.js or Compass to manage your resources, I highly recommend doing so. Live recompilation and minimizing built in.

[Ember.JS](http://ender.no.de/)



and hack away to your hearts content.
