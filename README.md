MetroCSS
========

Incorporates
------------
*	jQuery 1.5.1 (will be updated)
*	SASS for cleaner CSS code
*	user-definable color themes
*	minimized assets (to be implemented)
*	starter index.html


I wanted to create a starter template for anyone who wanted to create a Metro style homepage

Just run:
``git clone git@github.com:adamrobbie/metrocss.git``

If you haven't installed Ember.js or Compass to manage your resources, I highly recommend doing so. Live recompilation and minimizing built in.
[Compass](http://compass-style.org/)
[Ember.JS](http://emberjs.com/)


and hack away to your hearts content.

Much thanks goes to Mohammad Valipour (http://manorey.net/mohblog) for inpsiration and a good jumping off point.
